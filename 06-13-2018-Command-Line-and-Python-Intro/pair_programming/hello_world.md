# Hello World

## Create a new folder on your computer
Call it `hello_world`
```bash
cd hello_world
```

## Create a new file called hello.py

Macs:
```bash
touch hello.py
```

PCs:
```bash
New-Item new_file.txt -type file
```

## Open the folder in Atom

```bash
atom .
```

_Note: This might be have differently for Windows computers. You may need to manually open the file like we did earlier. For Macs you need to install shell commands an this only works when Atom is open on your computer_

## Edit the file to say:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Run the file from the command line

```bash
python hello.py
```

## If you have extra time adjust this to say different things
Maybe print your name or any other message you want.
