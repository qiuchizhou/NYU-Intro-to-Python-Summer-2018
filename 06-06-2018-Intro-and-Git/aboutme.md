<h2>**Hello World**</h2>

<h2>What's my motivation</h2>
My name is Rachel and I'm currently working as an integration engineer at CyberSecurity start up in NYC. I've been an engineer for about a year and half and while I'm pretty comfortable with front-end programming languages, I don't feel like I'm fluent in the full 'stack'. I'd really like to become a fullstack, software engineer and Python seems like the most relevant server-side language to learn. Also, basically every start up I've ever worked at used Python, so I learning Python will allow me to build server-side applications AND help inform my understanding of data modeling.

<h2>Area of Interest</h2>
I'm primarily interested in learning Python to build and map server-side applications and API requests. 

<h2>Fun Facts!</h2>
1. I have a tiny dog dog named Gidget (see my Github profile)
2. I'm a polyglot. I can speak:
	* Spanish
	* French
	* Portuguese
	* Italian
	* Hebrew
3. I make a really great chocolate chip banana bread
4. I have an encyclopedic knowledge of serial killers

<h2>Favorite Movie</h2>
It *really* depends on my mood, but generally its usually a tie between 'Almost Famous' and 'FernGully'

<h2>Dream Project</h2>
Really great question. Since I'm learning Python, I should probably do something that requires synthesizing some data sets, but for some reason, I suspect that my final project will end up involving snacks or tiny animals.
