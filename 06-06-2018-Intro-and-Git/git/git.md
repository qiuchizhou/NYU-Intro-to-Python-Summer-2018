# Git and GitHub

## A note for the PC crew
You will need to make sure you download [Git](https://git-scm.com/). Check out these directions for [Windows Users](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/#platform-windows)

## Git
Did you ever wish you could go back in time. With Git you can. Git is a version control tool. Git keeps track of changes across a collection of files for us. When we use Git, we can see what changes we made and seamlessly merge them with changes from our coworkers.

This is a tool we are going to us daily as developers. This was we introduce this concept on the very first day so that we already have some familiarity with the subject.

## GitHub
GitHub is a social wrapper for git. This allows us to fork and make pull requests as we did in the first class. We can therefore also host our code on GitHub.

## Repositories
Repositories are the central place where things are kept.

## How to create one
To create a repo you can go into GitHub and click on the bit + in the right hand corner.

## Cloning
Cloning allows us to bring our repository into our own environment

## Forking
Forking gives us our own version of repository that we can make changes and it can live independently of each other.

## How to create a repository and add files to it
1. Create a repository in GitHub
2. Clone it into your local environment
```
git clone <new repository>
```
You will likely be prompted to enter in your GitHub username and password. If you have 2 factor auth turned on which you should (two factor all the things). If you are using HTTPS Git, instead of entering your password, enter a personal access token. These can be created by going to your
[personal access tokens page](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

3. Open this directory in an atom and write code!
```
atom .
```
4. Pull any changes
```
git status
git pull
```
5.  When you are reached a stopping point. Add your files to the staging area.
```
git status
git add name_of_file.py
```
If you want to commit all the files you can use the following syntax. Be very careful with this.

```
git add .
```
6. Commit it
```
git status
git commit -m "descriptive commit message"
```
7. Push the changes to directory.
```
git status
git push
```
